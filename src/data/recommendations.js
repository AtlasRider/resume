// Bill is a great asset to our mobile development team and was key in delivering our products on time. Bill owns the development role and always is looking for better ways to implement our ideas. Being current in both technical and usability frameworks, Bill was able to expedite an MVP product and quickly iterate to increase the value to our customers.

// Bill fosters a wide range of interests even as he strives to master the art of mobile development. He is the quintessential friendly professional. I had the honor of sitting next to Bill at ShiftWise where I often solicited his help. He always treated me with respect while he patiently talked me through whatever problem I encountered.

// Every job supplies a range of both stressful and tranquil moments and Bill has mastered the art of remaining steady and reasonable through all of it. He will quickly earn both your trust and respect. I deeply admire both his attitude and his expertise and expect him to excel at whatever occupation he chooses to pursue in the future.

// While I worked at ShiftWise, Bill was our primary mobile application developer. He proved to me time and again how important it is to be flexible, knowledgeable, and creative. As I was new to mobile development (using Xamarin), I had a lot to learn from Bill, and I found him to be a patient and effective teacher. In addition, Bill has a great, dry sense of humor, and is friendly and easy to get along with. I highly recommend Bill for whichever job is lucky enough to attract him.

// Bill was initially hired to fill a front-end need on the team, but it quickly became apparent he excels with multiple back-end languages as well and could be tasked with a large array of project types and technologies. A superb knowledge of systems from the ground up. Witty, smart, jack-of-all-trades, and an all around great guy.
